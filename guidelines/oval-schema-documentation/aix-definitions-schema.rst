Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language: AIX Definition  
=========================================================
* Schema: AIX Definition  
* Version: 5.12.1  
* Release Date: 05/23/2025 09:00:00 AM

The following is a description of the elements, types, and attributes that compose the AIX specific tests found in Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL). Each test is an extension of the standard test element defined in the Core Definition Schema. Through extension, each test inherits a set of elements and attributes that are shared amongst all OVAL tests. Each test is described in detail and should provide the information necessary to understand what each element and attribute represents. This document is intended for developers and assumes some familiarity with XML. A high level description of the interaction between the different tests and their relationship to the Core Definition Schema is not outlined here.

This schema was originally developed by Yuzheng Zhou and Todd Dolinsky at Hewlett-Packard. The OVAL Schema is maintained by the OVAL Community. For more information, including how to get involved in the project and how to submit change requests, please visit the OVAL website at https://github.com/OVAL-Community/.

< interim_fix_test > (Deprecated)  
---------------------------------------------------------
Deprecation Info  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Deprecated As Of Version 5.12  
* Reason:   
* Comment: This test has been deprecated due to lack of documented usage and will be removed in version 6.0 of the language.  
  
The interim fix test is used to check information associated with different interim or emergency fixes installed on the system. The information being tested is based off the emgr -l -u VUID command. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. The required object element references an interim_fix_object and the optional state element specifies the information to check.

The interim_fix_object element is used by a interim_fix_test to define the specific fix to be evaluated. Each object extends the standard ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description for more information. The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic. Again, please refer to the description of the set element in the oval-definitions-schema.

An interim_fix_object consists of a single vuid entity that identifies the fix to be used.

The nfso test is used to check information related to the /usr/sbin/nfso command and the parameters it manages. The nfso command sets or displays current or next boot values for network file system (NFS) tuning parameters. The information being tested is based off the /usr/sbin/nfso -o command. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. The required object element references a nfso_object and the optional state element specifies the value to check for.
