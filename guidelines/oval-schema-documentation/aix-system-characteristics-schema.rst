Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language: AIX System Characteristics  
=========================================================
* Schema: AIX System Characteristics  
* Version: 5.12.1  
* Release Date: 05/23/2025 09:00:00 AM

The following is a description of the elements, types, and attributes that compose the AIX specific system characteristic items found in Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL). Each item is an extension of the standard test element defined in the Core Definition Schema. Through extension, each test inherits a set of elements and attributes that are shared amongst all OVAL tests. Each test is described in detail and should provide the information necessary to understand what each element and attribute represents. This document is intended for developers and assumes some familiarity with XML. A high level description of the interaction between the different tests and their relationship to the Core Definition Schema is not outlined here.

This schema was originally developed by Yuzheng Zhou and Todd Dolinsky at Hewlett-Packard. The OVAL Schema is maintained by the OVAL Community. For more information, including how to get involved in the project and how to submit change requests, please visit the OVAL website at https://github.com/OVAL-Community/.

    * - Value  
      - Description  
    * - respawn  
      - | If the process does not exist, start the process. Do not wait for its termination (continue scanning the /etc/inittab file). Restart the process when it dies. If the process exists, do nothing and continue scanning the /etc/inittab file.  
    * - wait  
      - | When the init command enters the run level that matches the entry's run level, start the process and wait for its termination  
    * - once  
      - | When the init command enters a run level that matches the entry's run level, start the process, and do not wait for its termination  
    * - boot  
      - | Process the entry only during system boot, which is when the init command reads the /etc/inittab file during system startup  
    * - bootwait  
      - | Process the entry the first time that the init command goes from single-user to multi-user state after the system is booted  
    * - powerfail  
      - | Execute the process associated with this entry only when the init command receives a power fail signal (SIGPWR)  
    * - powerwait  
      - | Execute the process associated with this entry only when the init command receives a power fail signal (SIGPWR), and wait until it terminates  
    * - off

      - | Functionally identical to respawn, except this action applies to the a, b, or c values, not to run levels  
    * - initdefault  
      - | An entry with this action is only scanned when the init command is initially invoked
