Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language: Amazon Web Services Definition  
=========================================================
* Schema: Amazon Web Services Definition  
* Version: 5.12.1  
* Release Date: 05/23/2025 09:00:00 AM

The following is a description of the elements, types, and attributes that compose the specific tests required to assess Amazon Web Services (AWS) managed services found in Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL). Each test is an extension of the standard test element defined in the Core Definition Schema. Through extension, each test inherits a set of elements and attributes that are shared amongst all OVAL tests. Each test is described in detail and should provide the information necessary to understand what each element and attribute represents. This document is intended for developers and assumes some familiarity with XML. A high level description of the interaction between the different tests and their relationship to the Core Definition Schema is not outlined here.

The OVAL Schema is maintained by the OVAL Community. For more information, including how to get involved in the project and how to submit change requests, please visit the OVAL website at https://github.com/OVAL-Community/.

---------------------------------------------------------
The AWS api_test is used to leverage the AWS infrastructure API in order to check various attributes collected from the myriad services offered by AWS. The test extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. The required object element references a api_object and the optional state element specifies the metadata to check.

< api_object >  
---------------------------------------------------------
The api_object element is used by a api_test to identify the set of AWS API endpoints to use and the parameters to provide to them for checking the state of an AWS infrastructure. In order to ensure the consistency of AWS API support among OVAL interpreters as well as ensure that the state of a system is not changed, every OVAL interpreter must implement the following requirements. An OVAL interpreter must only support the processing of the verbs specified in the EntityObjectAWSVerbType. If a verb that is not defined in this enumeration is discovered, an error should be reported and the AWS API must not be invoked. While XML schema validation will enforce this requirement, it is strongly recommended that OVAL interpreters implement a whitelist of allowed AWS API verbs. This may be accomplished by utilizing the AWS credential profile for an IAM user granted only the required permissions. Furthermore, OVAL interpreters are expected to format API response objects as XML content for use by the object's XPath element value.

      - Specifies an JSONPath expression to evaluate against the output constructed from the API Response object. This JSONPath expression must evaluate to a list of zero or more text values which will be accessible in OVAL via instances of the value_of entity. Any results from evaluating the JSONPath expression other than a list of text strings (e.g., a nodes set) is considered an error. The intention is that the text values be drawn from instances of a single, uniquely named node or attribute. However, an OVAL interpreter is not required to verify this, so the author should define the JSONPath expression carefully. Note that "equals" is the only valid operator for the JSONPath entity.

    * - Child Elements  
      - Type (MinOccurs..MaxOccurs)  
      - Desc.  
    * - api_version  
      - oval-def:EntityObjectVersionType (1..1)  
      - The api_version entity defines the version of the AWS API/CLI to use. If xsi:nil='true', that implies it does not matter which version of the API/CLI the command refers to.  
    * - service_name

      - The AWS API noun.  
    * - parameters  
      - oval-def:EntityObjectRecordType (1..1)  
      - A list of properties (name and value pairs) as input to invoke the AWS API method. Each property name must be unique. When xsi:nil='true', parameters are not provided to the API method.  
    * - pattern  
      - oval-def:EntityObjectStringType (1..1)  
      - The pattern entity defines a chunk of text in a file and is represented using a regular expression. A subexpression (using parentheses) can call out a piece of the text block to test. For example, the pattern abc(.*)xyz would look for a block of text in the file that starts with abc and ends with xyz, with the subexpression being all the characters that exist in between. The value of the subexpression can then be tested using the subexpression entity of a textfilecontent54_state. Note that if the pattern, starting at the same point in the file, matches more than one block of text, then it matches the longest. For example, given a file with abcdefxyzxyzabc, then the pattern abc(.*)xyz would match the block abcdefxyzxyz. Subexpressions also match the longest possible substrings, subject to the constraint that the whole match be as long as possible, with subexpressions starting earlier in the pattern taking priority over ones starting later.Note that when using regular expressions, OVAL supports a common subset of the regular expression character classes, operations, expressions and other lexical tokens defined within Perl 5's regular expression specification. For more information on the supported regular expression syntax in OVAL see: http://oval.mitre.org/language/about/re_support_5.6.html.  
    * - instance  
      - oval-def:EntityObjectIntType (1..1)  
      - The instance entity calls out a specific match of the pattern. It can have any integer value. If the value is a non-negative integer, the index of the specific match of the pattern is counted from the beginning of the set of matches of that pattern in the targeted file. The first match is given an instance value of 1, the second match is given an instance value of 2, and so on. For non-negative values, the 'less than' and 'less than or equal' operations imply the the object is operating only on non-negative values. Frequently, this entity will be defined as 'greater than or equal' to 1 or 'greater than' 0, either of which results in the object representing the set of all matches of the pattern.Negative values are used to simplify collection of pattern match occurrences counting backwards from the final match in the targeted file. To find the final match, use an instance of -1; the penultimate match is found using an instance value of -2, and so on. For negative values, the 'greater than' and 'greater than or equal' operations imply the object is operating only on negative values. For example, searching for instances greater than or equal to -2 would yield only the last two maches.Note that the main purpose of the instance item entity is to provide uniqueness for different textfilecontent_items that results from multiple matches of a given pattern against the same file, and they will always have positive values.

      - oval-def:EntityStateAnySimpleType (0..1)  
      - The subexpression entity represents a value to test against the subexpression in the specified pattern. If multiple subexpressions are specified in the pattern, this value is tested against all of them. For example, if the pattern abc(.*)mno(.*)xyp was supplied, and the state specifies a subexpression value of enabled, then the test would check that both (or at least one, none, etc. depending on the entity_check attribute) of the subexpressions have a value of enabled.

< credentialreportuser_test >  
---------------------------------------------------------
The credentialreportuser_test allows for the evaluation of results from generating and retrieving a Credentials Report utilizing either the AWS CLI or the AWS API, and parsing user information. The credential report is generated for all users of the credentialed account being used to access the AWS environment.

From the AWS CLI, implementers must first generate a credential report using the "aws iam generate-credential-report" command. Once completed, implementers can retrieve the last generated report using the "aws iam get-credential-report" command.

From the AWS API, implementers must first generate a credential report using the "GenerateCredentialReport" method. Once completed, implementers can retrieve the last generated report using the "GetCredentialReport" method.

Once retrieved, the content of the report is a base64-encoded string that, once decoded, represents a blob of CSV. Each line of the CSV represents an item, with each comma-separated field an element in this construct. The first line of the CSV denotes the column header, represented in this element as each field.

From the AWS CLI, implementers must first generate a credential report using the "aws iam generate-credential-report" command. Once completed, implementers can retrieve the last generated report using the "aws iam get-credential-report" command.

From the AWS API, implementers must first generate a credential report using the "GenerateCredentialReport" method. Once completed, implementers can retrieve the last generated report using the "GetCredentialReport" method.

Once retrieved, the content of the report is a base64-encoded string that, once decoded, represents a blob of CSV. Each line of the CSV represents an item, with each comma-separated field an element in this construct. The first line of the CSV denotes the column header, represented in this element as each field.

== EntityObjectAWSVerbType ==  
---------------------------------------------------------
